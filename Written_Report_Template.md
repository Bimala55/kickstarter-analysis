# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Knowing how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We create a pivot table from the Kickstarter worksheet and filter it based on "Years" and on "Parent Category" to only show data for "theater". We also filter the column labels to only show "successful", "failed" and "canceled". We visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month by creating a line chart from the pivot table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. We create dollar-amount ranges so projects can be grouped based on their goal amount. We populate the "Total Projects" column with the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row. We also calculate the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row. We create a line chart to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
