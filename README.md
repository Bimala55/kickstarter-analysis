# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
This project uses Excel to organize, sort and analyzes Kickstarter crowd funding data to determine specific factors for project success. For the analysis we created the visualizations below.

## Visualizations 
We can see by looking at the line chart that the months of May,June and July have a greater success rate.

We can see by looking at the bar chart that the Theater category has the most number of success and failures.

When we analyze the sub category data for Great Britain, the bar chart shows Plays is the most successful.

When we analyze the sub category data for US, the bar chart shows Plays is the most successful.

## Recommendations
- Louise should launch her campaign between May and July. 
- Louise is asking for $10000 for her compaign which is more  than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so she should consider changing it to $5000.
- Louise should try to get play produced for less than Â£4,000 because this is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged.
